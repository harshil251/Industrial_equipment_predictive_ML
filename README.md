## 🧠 Machine Learning Techniques Used

### 🔹 Anomaly Detection

* **Isolation Forest**

  * Identifies rare and abnormal machine behavior
  * Suitable for unlabeled and high-dimensional sensor data

* **Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise(DBSCAN)**
  
  * It does not require the user to specify the number of clusters in advance.
  * It is effective at identifying and handling noise/outliers by not assigning them to any cluster. 

### 🔹 Classification Models

* **Random Forest Classifier**
* **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**

### 🔹 Additional Techniques

* Feature scaling and encoding
* Correlation analysis between sensor parameters
* Threshold identification for critical conditions
